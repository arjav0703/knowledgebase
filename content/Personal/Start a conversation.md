The key step to get some interested in what you is to **start with something they love** (like their hobby, passion etc.) This will make them eager to talk to you. 

If they are interested, continue talking about the topic for a bit like talking about past experience, common problems faced etc. and and then shift the conversation to what you wanna talk about. 

> Don't begin directly with what you wanna tell them, first, make them eager to talk

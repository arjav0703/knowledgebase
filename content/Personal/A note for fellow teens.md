I want you to **realise** there's so much in life other than school. **School and academics is not everything**. Step up from all of this *bs* and **find what you fucking love**.

Look at me for example. I love computers, coding and Tech. I could've gone through *the so called "normal" path of giving JEE* and all that bs but I chose to do it now. 

I don't trust a college that asks students to give an exam on Physics, Chem and Math to get an admission for C.S. and then teaches C.S. stuff that decades old. I'd rather surround myself with people who are already doing it like people at hackclub rather than being with people who are *trapped* in this bs path. 

#### If you really love something, do it now and prove it to the world.

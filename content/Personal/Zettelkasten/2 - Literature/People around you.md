##### Similarity
When you surround yourself with like minded people who are working on the same goal, it lifts your 'Minimum Hygiene level', and makes you work harder.


##### Opposition
If you take an immature decision and surround yourself with people based on a wrong goal, it might lead you to a wrong path.


##### Conclusion
## Goal setting is important.
Surround yourself with people with right goal but do not let them influence too much, **use it as a network rather than a inspiration**

###### Similarity 

Your Identity shapes your worldview. *Whenever you are trying to build or destroy a habit, start with your identity.*
- For example, if you are trying to quit 'x' behavior, try saying, **"I am not the kind of person who does 'x'. "** Instead of, 'I am trying to quit x. 
- And Vice versa

This can be used to set your goals. For example:
- The goal is not to read, it is to *become a reader.*
- The goal is not to lose fat, it is to *become a healthy person.*

### How to apply this?

1. Decide the type of person you want to be. 
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

Ask the questions:
- **Who is the type of person who could do x task?**
	- Note their qualities like consistency, trustworthy etc.
- **What would a x type of person do in this situation**
###### Opposition

This can also make you **resist change** because you *tie yourself in norms attached to your identity*

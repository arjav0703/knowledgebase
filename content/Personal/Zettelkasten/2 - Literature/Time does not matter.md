###### Similarity
It doesn't matter when you start to do some thing. No matter what the current circumstances are, or what your age is. All it takes to be successful is to start doing it.

###### Opposition
Humans are constrained by their circumstances, life responsibilities, age, or limitations, making it difficult or impossible to achieve their aspirations. These factors can significantly hinder one's ability to pursue dreams.

People may feel that their dreams are unattainable due to external barriers or personal limitations.

**If you do something at inappropriate time, you might miss the many opportunities that could had been availed if you were at the right time.**

#### Conclusion
> A perfect blend of timing, opportunities, and knowledge is what it takes to be successful.

**However in some cases, wrong timing can be compensated with the knowledge & skills you build.**

###### Systems

### **Winners and losers have the same fucking goal, YOU NEED TO STAND OUT**
- It is not the goal that leads to success, but it is the process behind it.


### Achieving the goal is only a momentary change.
- Let us say you achieve the goal, **What Next?**
	- > *You treated a symptom without addressing the cause*
		- You will be left chasing the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it.

> 	"The score takes care of itself."


### Goals Restrict Your Happiness
**Goals-first mentality puts happiness until you achieve your next milestone.**
- ##### It is an endless cycle that makes you a subordinate to your goals. #sovereignty
- It creates a situation where either you fail or you succeed, *there is no credit for trying and no room for improvement.*
*Also see [[Think what's ahead]]*

### Odds with Long-term progress
> *After you achieve your goals there is nothing left to do*

**Once you create a system, you fall in love with the process rather than the product**
- You do not have to give yourself permission to be happy. #sovereignty 
- > It is the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement

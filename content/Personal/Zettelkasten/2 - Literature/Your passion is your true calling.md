###### Similarity
*When we feel a strong pull toward something, it is a reflection of our true calling or mission in life.*

Our desires can lead us to fulfill our potential and contribute to the world in meaningful ways.

###### Opposition

*In some, cases our wants and aspirations may be shaped solely by experiences, societal influences, or external circumstances. These might not necessarily be our true calling*

You can't just cling on to the first thing that comes on your mind.
You need to:
- **Explore it**
        dig deeper into the concepts and find out what it is on a larger scale
- **Evaluate it**
		find the ground reality and see if it is actually good 
 - **Explore other alternatives** 
		 even if you think that the first one is good

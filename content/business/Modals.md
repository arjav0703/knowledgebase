### A list of business ideas I see in day to day life
- Connect artists to companies/clients **[Be a middleman]**
		
	 Artists do not have the ability to negotiate and find clients. 
	 **Purpose**: you are helping people creative people by taking away their worry to find clients and negotiate with them so that *they canactually focus on what they do and are good at !*
